from pathlib import Path


# Make sure the path to the downloaded text file is correct:
file_path = 'path/to/food.txt'


# Create a new Path and assign it to a variable.


# Verify that the path exists.
# Then open the file in read mode. Add each line to a new list 'foods'.


# TASK 1: FOODS
# Create a new dictionary containing lists of the foods by the letter each starts with.
# EX. { 'a': ['apples', 'ale'], 'b': ['banana'] ... 'x': [] } 


# Remove keys with empty lists from the food dictionary.


# Create a new dictionary that stores words based on how long they are.
# Then create the lists described below and add them to the dictionary.


# Add a list of all words with 5 letters and add it to the dictionary.


# Add a list of all words with 3 letters.


# Add a list of all words with 8 or more letters.


# Use this dictionary for the following tasks.
doubles = {'consonants': [], 'vowels': []}


# Add all words that contain a double consonant to the dictionary. (EX. 'orange')


# Add all words that contain a double vowel to the dictionary. (EX. 'soup')


# Add a list of all words which end with a vowel.
# EX. banana, sauce


# TASK 2: NUMBERS
# Use this dictionary and add the number lists below to it.
numbers = {}


# Create a list 'integers' of all numbers from 1-100. 
# Add it to the numbers dict.


# Create a list 'one' of all numbers from 101-200.
# Add it to the numbers dict.


# Create a list 'two' of all numbers from 1-200 divisible by 2.
# Add it to the numbers dict.


# Create a list 'three' of all numbers from 1-300 divisible by 3.
# Add it to the numbers dict.


# Create a new dictionary whose properties are even and odd numbers from the lists one, two and three.
# Add it to the numbers dict.


# Create a new list 'p1' of the products of lists one and two.
# Add it to the numbers dict.


# Create a new list 'p2' of the product of lists one and three.
# Add it to the numbers dict.


# Create a new list 's1' of the sum of lists one and three.
# Add it to the numbers dict.


# Using the numbers dict, print the largest number from p2.


# Using the numbers dict, print the largest number from p1.


# Using the numbers dict, print the sum of all numbers from list numbers.


# Using the numbers dict, print the sum of all numbers from list s1.


# Using the numbers dict, print a list of all numbers starting with 2 from list two.


# Using the numbers dict, print a list of all numbers starting with 3 from list three.
