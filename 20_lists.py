# within and put them into a single list. 

# TASK 1
# Sort the colors list in alphabetical order. Print it. 
# Print each list backwards

# Sort the numbers list from greatest to lowest. Print it. 


# Print every 3rd item from each list


# Print every 2nd item of each list, starting at the 2nd item. 


# Print the last 2 items of each list. 


# Using the numbers list, create a new list containing only negative numbers. 


# Using the numbers list, create a new list containing only positive numbers. 


# Using the colors list, create a new list containing colors that contain ... 
# - the letter 'a' 
# - the letter 'l' 
# - 4 or less characters

# Combine colors and numbers into 1 new list. Print the new list. 

# TASK 2
# Print the first item in fish in the fish list.


# Print each fish capitalized.


# Print the names of fish with names longer thant 5 characters.
 

# Print the names of fish that start with the letter 'c' 


# Create a new fish list that contains fish found in all the lists in the fish list. 


# Using the colors list, create and print a new list for each item. 
# The new list should contain each character of the item. 
# EX. ['pink'] -> ['p', 'i', 'n', 'k']
